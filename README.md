# 966-Liars-Dice
9.66 Final Group Project


Playing Liars Dice according to these rules (No wild numbers):
Each player privately loads this page on their phone or computer and positions the device so that no other player can see the screen. The starting player announces the minimum number of instances of a particular number they think appear in total across all players' dice (eg. "seven 3s"). Going clockwise, each player may either raise the previous player's bid (either to a higher quantity of the same number, or any quantity of a higher number) or challenge it. When a challenge is made, everyone reveals their screens; if the challenged prediction was correct (ie. at least that many instances of the number are present, including wild 1s), the predicter wins, otherwise the challenger wins. The loser of the challenge loses one die and they open the next round; when a player runs out of dice, they're eliminated.
